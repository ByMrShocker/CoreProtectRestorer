The plugin was created to restore the world after server griefing. 
Since CoreProtect only records actions that were intercepted via EventHandler, actions performed using WorldEdit or cheats cannot be restored. 
This plugin scans the database and searches for all records related to the necessary blocks in order to restore them.


The plugin can restore actions performed using Axiom Mod, as it is recorded in the database.
However, actions performed using WorldEdit cannot be restored.
